        <p style = "font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">As the title already suggests, my name is Matthew, and I am a first year at the <mark>British Columbia Institute of Technology(BCIT)</mark>. For those who don't know, I am not straight out of highschool as some of my other classmates may be, but I am definitely of legal drinking age in the US.  In fact, it's been a long while since I've found myself in a classroom setting. Part of the reason why is because I hated the idea of committing x number of years to a major before having the time to discover what I want to do, rather than what my parents wanted me to do. Jumping around from one odd job to another, I've realized the importance of having a higher education to make ends meet; especially here in <ins>Vancouver</ins>. And having picked up several life lessons along the way, I decided I wanted to pick up computing because it will provide me with the skills to work in an evergrowing society, and allow me to work either for someone or independently.</p>

Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating a software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, analyze problems, discover requirements and create a logical design. Topics include: techniques used in the discovery of business requirements, traditional approaches to data and process modelling, entity-relationship diagrams, and an introduction to relational database normalization. Agile life cycles such as Scrum are also introduced and compared to more planned life cycles such as waterfall. By the end of this course, successful participants will be able to use tools and methods commonly used in industry to analyze, design, and implement information systems as confirmed by a term project.</p>
