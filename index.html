        <h1 style = "font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><strong>A Brief Summary Of Matthew Kan</strong></h1>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif; font-size:larger;">As the title already suggests, my name is Matthew, and I am a first year at the <mark>British Columbia Institute of Technology(BCIT)</mark>. For those who don't know, I am not straight out of highschool as some of my other classmates may be, but I am definitely of legal drinking age in the US.  In fact, it's been a long while since I've found myself in a classroom setting. Part of the reason why is because I hated the idea of committing x number of years to a major before having the time to discover what I want to do, rather than what my parents wanted me to do. Jumping around from one odd job to another, I've realized the importance of having a higher education to make ends meet; especially here in <ins>Vancouver</ins>. And having picked up several life lessons along the way, I decided I wanted to pick up computing because it will provide me with the skills to work in an evergrowing society, and allow me to work either for someone or independently.</p>
